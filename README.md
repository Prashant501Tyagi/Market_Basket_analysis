Project Description

Imagine that you are a restaurant sales manager, and a customer has asked you to recommend a few dishes from the menu. What do you do in such a scenario? Simple! You use the market basket analysis technique to deduce the recommendations so that customers are more likely to buy your recommended dish. This project will help you understand market basket analysis (MBA) with examples, its advantages, and the different types of MBA. In the end, you will find a brief overview of the MBA project solution.

Introduction to Market Basket Analysis in Data Mining
There are a few market basket analysis terms you need to understand before you can start working on the project. 

Market Basket Analysis Definition
Analysis of historical customer data can highlight if a specific combination of products purchased makes an additional purchase more likely. This is called market basket analysis (also called MBA). It is a widely used technique to identify the best possible mix of frequently bought products or services, and it is also called product association analysis. 

The set of items a customer buys is referred to as an itemset, and market basket analysis seeks to find relationships between purchases of different items. 

Market Basket Analysis creates If-Then scenario rules; for example, if item A is purchased, then item B is likely to be bought. The rules are probabilistic, or in other words, they are derived from the frequencies of co-occurrence in the observations. Market Basket analysis is particularly useful for physical retail stores as it can help plan floor space and product placement, among many other benefits.

Understanding Market Basket Analysis with Example
Market Basket Analysis is a type of frequent itemset mining technique that analyzes customer buying habits and deduces association rules among items purchased by customers.

For example, suppose you are the sales manager of a retail store, and you are looking for the answer to the question, “Which itemset are customers likely to buy on their visit to the store?”.The correct answer lies in analyzing customer buying habits using Market Basket Analysis. MBA makes it easy for retailers to understand what sets of items are frequently purchased together and assists them in arranging those items on their shelves to achieve higher sales than usual.
